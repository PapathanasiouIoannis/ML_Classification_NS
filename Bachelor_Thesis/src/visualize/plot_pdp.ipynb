    "# Partial Dependence Plot Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is used to interpret the decision-making logic of the trained machine learning models. It generates Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs), which visualize how the predicted probability of a star being a \"Quark Star\" changes as a single feature is varied, while the effects of all other features are averaged out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script focuses on two distinct models:\n",
    "1.  **Model A:** To understand how macroscopic observables (Mass, Radius, Tidal Deformability) influence the classification.\n",
    "2.  **Model D:** To understand how microscopic properties (Density, Sound Speed, Topology) drive the model's decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physics and Math\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partial Dependence Function\n",
    "The machine learning models approximate a function $f(X)$ that outputs the probability of the positive class (Quark). To understand the marginal effect of a specific feature $x_S$ (e.g., Radius) independent of the other features $X_C$, the partial dependence function is computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the partial dependence function $\\hat{f}_{x_S}$ is estimated by averaging the model predictions over the distribution of the other features in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{f}_{x_S}(x_S) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} f(x_S, x_{C}^{(i)})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\{x_{C}^{(1)}, \\dots, x_{C}^{(N)}\\}$ are the values of the complementary features observed in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Y-Axis:** Represents the average predicted probability $P(\\text{Quark})$.\n",
    "*   **X-Axis:** Represents the range of values for the feature of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique reveals whether the model has learned physically meaningful relationships (e.g., \"smaller radii imply a higher probability of being a Quark star\") or if it is relying on artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Configuration\n",
    "Common settings for the PDP calculation are defined, such as the grid resolution (number of points on the x-axis) and the method (`kind='average'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "common_params = {\n",
    "    \"kind\": \"average\",      \n",
    "    \"grid_resolution\": 50,  \n",
    "    \"percentiles\": (0.01, 0.99),\n",
    "    \"n_jobs\": -1\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Plot 1: Observables (Model A)\n",
    "The script first checks if `Model A` is present in the input dictionary.\n",
    "*   **Feature Selection:** The features `Mass`, `Radius`, and `LogLambda` are selected.\n",
    "*   **Computation:** `PartialDependenceDisplay.from_estimator` computes the curves efficiently using the tree structure of the Random Forest.\n",
    "*   **Formatting:** Axis limits are applied from `CONSTANTS`. A horizontal line at $P=0.5$ marks the decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Plot 2: Microphysics (Model D)\n",
    "The script then processes `Model D`, which was trained on internal physics features.\n",
    "*   **Feature Selection:** `Eps_Central` (Density), `CS2_Central` (Sound Speed), and `Slope14` (Topology) are analyzed.\n",
    "*   **Shading:** For the \"Slope\" panel, background shading is added to highlight physical regimes:\n",
    "    *   **Red Region (Slope < 0):** Hadronic-like behavior (gravitational compression dominates).\n",
    "    *   **Green Region (Slope > 0):** Quark-like behavior (vacuum pressure stabilizes the star against gravity).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Left of 0.0: Hadronic-like (Collapsing branch)\n",
    "axes[2].axvspan(CONSTANTS['PLOT_SLOPE_LIM'][0], 0.0, color=COLORS['H_main'], alpha=0.1)\n",
    "# Right of 0.0: Quark-like (Stable branch)\n",
    "axes[2].axvspan(0.0, CONSTANTS['PLOT_SLOPE_LIM'][1], color=COLORS['Q_main'], alpha=0.1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The script saves two PDF files to the `plots/` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `fig_pdp_observables.pdf`\n",
    "*   **Panels:** Mass, Radius, Log Tidal Deformability.\n",
    "*   **Y-Axis:** Probability $P(\\text{Quark})$.\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **Radius:** Typically shows a sharp increase in quark probability as radius decreases below $\\sim 11-12$ km.\n",
    "    *   **Tidal:** Shows how probability varies with deformability (Quark stars are often less deformable).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `fig_pdp_microphysics.pdf`\n",
    "*   **Panels:** Central Density, Sound Speed, Slope.\n",
    "*   **Y-Axis:** Probability $P(\\text{Quark})$.\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **Density:** Higher central densities generally correlate with higher quark probability.\n",
    "    *   **Sound Speed:** Shows if the model associates high stiffness ($c_s^2 > 1/3$) with quark matter.\n",
    "    *   **Slope:** Demonstrates the phase transition. The probability curve usually transitions from 0 to 1 as the slope crosses from negative to positive, confirming that the model utilizes the topological stability criterion."
