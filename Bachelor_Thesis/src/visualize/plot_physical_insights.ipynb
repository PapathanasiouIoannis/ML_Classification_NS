    "# Physical Insights Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is used to generate two key figures that provide physical and algorithmic insights into the project. First, it visualizes the **Feature Importance** of the most advanced machine learning model (Model D), quantifying the relative predictive power of macroscopic observables versus microscopic parameters. Second, it generates a **Speed of Sound** diagnostic plot, which contrasts the theoretical Equation of State (EoS) trajectories with the actual central conditions of the stable neutron stars in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physics and Math\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Gini Importance\n",
    "For the Random Forest classifier, the importance of a feature is measured by the total reduction in the Gini impurity criterion brought about by that feature. This metric identifies which physical parameters (e.g., Radius vs. Slope) are most effective at splitting the Hadronic and Quark populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Speed of Sound\n",
    "The speed of sound squared, $c_s^2$, is a measure of the stiffness of the nuclear matter:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c_s^2 = \\frac{dP}{d\\epsilon}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This quantity is plotted against the energy density $\\epsilon$. Two theoretical limits are visualized:\n",
    "*   **Causal Limit:** $c_s^2 = 1$ (the speed of light).\n",
    "*   **Conformal Limit:** $c_s^2 = 1/3$ (the asymptotic limit for massless quarks).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Feature Importance (Figure 13)\n",
    "The script first checks if `Model D` (the model trained on both macro and micro features) is available.\n",
    "*   **Data Retrieval:** The `feature_importances_` attribute is accessed. This attribute is manually patched onto the `CalibratedClassifierCV` object during the training phase in `train_model.py`.\n",
    "*   **Categorization:** Features are split into two groups for visualization:\n",
    "    *   **Macroscopic (Observables):** Mass, Radius, Tidal Deformability.\n",
    "    *   **Microscopic (Topology):** Central Density, Speed of Sound, Slope.\n",
    "*   **Plotting:** A horizontal bar chart is generated to compare the influence of these two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Split into Macro (Obs) vs Micro (Physics)\n",
    "idx_obs = [0, 1, 2] # Mass, Radius, Lambda\n",
    "idx_mic = [3, 4, 5] # Eps, CS2, Slope\n",
    "\n",
    "ax.barh(y_pos_obs, importances[idx_obs], label='Macroscopic')\n",
    "ax.barh(y_pos_mic, importances[idx_mic], label='Microscopic')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Speed of Sound Diagnostics (Figure 15)\n",
    "This figure overlays two types of data to show where stable stars reside within the theoretical parameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Background Lines (\"Roads\"):** The full EoS trajectories ($c_s^2$ vs. $\\epsilon$) are plotted for a subset of models. These lines show the functional form of the stiffness across all densities.\n",
    "*   **Scatter Points (\"Cities\"):** The specific central conditions ($\\epsilon_c, c_{s,c}^2$) of actual stable stars are plotted as dots.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction is important because an EoS might be stiff at high densities, but if the star collapses before reaching those densities, that stiffness is irrelevant to the stable population.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Plot the \"Roads\" (Full EoS Trajectories)\n",
    "ax.plot(g['Eps_Central'], g['CS2_Central'], ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot the \"Cities\" (Actual Stellar Cores)\n",
    "ax.scatter(h_dots['Eps_Central'], h_dots['CS2_Central'], ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard physical limits (Causal and Conformal) are drawn as horizontal lines for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The script saves two PDF files to the `plots/` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`fig_13_feature_importance.pdf`**:\n",
    "    *   **Y-axis:** Feature Names (e.g., Mass, Radius, Slope).\n",
    "    *   **X-axis:** Gini Importance Score.\n",
    "    *   **Visuals:** Blue bars represent Observables; Red bars represent Microphysics. This plot typically shows that \"Slope\" and \"Radius\" are dominant predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`fig_15_speed_of_sound.pdf`**:\n",
    "    *   **X-axis:** Central Energy Density $\\varepsilon_c$ [MeV/fm$^3$].\n",
    "    *   **Y-axis:** Central Speed of Sound Squared $c_s^2$.\n",
    "    *   **Visuals:**\n",
    "        *   Faint lines show the full EoS evolution.\n",
    "        *   Scatter points show the central values of stable stars.\n",
    "        *   Quark models (Magenta) often cluster near or above the conformal limit ($1/3$), while Hadronic models (Green) show varied behavior."
