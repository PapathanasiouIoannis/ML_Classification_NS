    "# Surface Density Gap Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is used to generate a specific physical validation plot that highlights the fundamental difference in boundary conditions between Hadronic stars and Quark stars. It visualizes the distribution of the surface energy density ($\\varepsilon_{surf}$) for both populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal is to demonstrate the existence of a \"Forbidden Gap.\" Hadronic stars, which are bound by gravity, have surface densities effectively at zero (on nuclear scales). In contrast, Quark stars, which are self-bound by the strong interaction and vacuum pressure, maintain a finite density even where the pressure vanishes at the surface. This script visualizes this dichotomy to confirm that the generated models adhere to these theoretical constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physics and Math\n",
    "\n",
    "The boundary of a neutron star is defined where the pressure drops to zero ($P(R) = 0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Hadronic Boundary (Gravity-Bound)\n",
    "For hadronic matter, the star is enveloped by a crust of atomic nuclei (e.g., Iron). The density at the surface drops to atomic scales ($\\sim 7.8 \\text{ g/cm}^3$), which is negligible compared to nuclear saturation density ($\\sim 2.8 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ g/cm}^3$).\n",
    "In the simulation units (MeV/fm$^3$), this is effectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\varepsilon_{surf}^{Hadronic} \\approx 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Quark Boundary (Self-Bound)\n",
    "For Quark stars described by the Bag Model or CFL model, the pressure vanishes only when the quark chemical potential cancels out the vacuum pressure $B$. From the thermodynamic relation $P = \\frac{1}{3}(\\epsilon - 4B)$, the condition $P=0$ implies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\varepsilon_{surf}^{Quark} \\approx 4B\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Bag Constant $B$ has a physical lower bound (roughly $57$ MeV/fm$^3$), the surface density of a Quark star must always be finite and substantial, creating a gap between $0$ and $\\sim 4B_{min}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Preparation\n",
    "The script checks for the existence of the `Eps_Surface` column. It extracts the surface density values for the Quark population (`Label == 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "q_vals = df[df['Label']==1]['Eps_Surface']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Plotting the Distributions\n",
    "The visualization is constructed in layers to show the contrast between the two populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Quark Distribution:** A Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) is plotted for `q_vals` to show the spread of surface densities resulting from the variation in Bag Constant $B$ and Gap parameter $\\Delta$.\n",
    "*   **Hadronic Spike:** Since the hadronic surface density is effectively a Dirac delta function at zero, it is represented by a vertical line at $x=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Plot Quark Distribution (The Hill)\n",
    "sns.kdeplot(x=q_vals, ..., label='Quark Surface Density')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot Hadronic (The Spike)\n",
    "ax.axvline(0, color=COLORS['H_main'], ..., label='Hadronic Boundary')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Visualizing the Forbidden Gap\n",
    "The script calculates the minimum observed surface density in the Quark population (`gap_limit`). The region between zero and this minimum is shaded to represent the physically forbidden region where no stable compact star surface can exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gap_limit = q_vals.min()\n",
    "ax.axvspan(0, gap_limit, color='gray', alpha=0.1, hatch='///')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Annotations are added to explain the physical significance of the two regimes (Gravity-Bound vs. Self-Bound).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The script generates a single PDF file: `plots/fig_surface_density.pdf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **X-Axis:** Surface Energy Density $\\varepsilon_{surf}$ [MeV/fm$^3$].\n",
    "*   **Y-Axis:** Probability Density.\n",
    "*   **Visual Features:**\n",
    "    *   **Vertical Green Line:** Located at $x=0$, representing the iron crust of Hadronic stars.\n",
    "    *   **Magenta Hill:** A distribution starting at $x \\approx 200$ MeV/fm$^3$, representing the finite surface of Quark stars.\n",
    "    *   **Hatched Grey Area:** The \"Forbidden Gap\" separating the two distinct boundary conditions."
