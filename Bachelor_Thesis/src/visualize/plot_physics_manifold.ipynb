    "# Mass-Radius Manifold Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This script generates the primary visual summaries of the neutron star dataset in the Mass-Radius ($M-R$) plane. It produces \"triptych\" (three-panel) figures that compare the populations of Hadronic and Quark stars side-by-side and in superposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two distinct visualization styles are implemented:\n",
    "1.  **Statistical View (KDE):** Uses Kernel Density Estimation to show the probability density of stable star configurations. This highlights where the populations are most likely to reside.\n",
    "2.  **Morphological View (Curves):** Plots the raw Equation of State (EoS) trajectories. This highlights the \"flow\" and topology of the curves, showing how individual families of stars evolve as central pressure increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physics and Math\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mass-Radius Relation\n",
    "The plots visualize the solution space of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. Each point $(R, M)$ represents a stable hydrostatic equilibrium configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Relativity Constraints\n",
    "The script visualizes the **Buchdahl Limit**, which defines the maximum compactness allowed for a static, spherically symmetric fluid sphere in General Relativity. A star cannot exist if its radius is smaller than:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R < \\frac{9}{4} \\frac{GM}{c^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code, this boundary is drawn using the conversion factor `A_CONV` ($\\approx 1.477$ km/$M_{\\odot}$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R_{limit}(M) \\approx 2.25 \\times \\text{A\\_CONV} \\times M\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)\n",
    "To visualize the statistical distribution of the populations, the script estimates the probability density function $P(R, M)$ using Gaussian kernels:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{P}(R, M) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} K_h(R - R_i, M - M_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $(R_i, M_i)$ are the data points and $h$ is the smoothing bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Preparation\n",
    "The data is grouped by `Curve_ID` to handle entire EoS sequences. For the background line plots, a subset of curves is randomly selected to prevent visual clutter and reduce file size.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sort by Density to ensure lines are drawn in physical order\n",
    "g = group.sort_values(by='Eps_Central')\n",
    "m_max = g['Mass'].max()\n",
    "stable_g = g[g['Mass'] <= m_max] \n",
    "```\n",
    "Only the stable branch (up to the maximum mass) is retained for the KDE calculation, as the unstable branch is astrophysically irrelevant for standard neutron stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. KDE Calculation\n",
    "The function `plot_physics_manifold` generates the statistical view. A grid is defined over the Mass-Radius plane (limits from `CONSTANTS`). The `scipy.stats.gaussian_kde` function computes the density of points on this grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "kernel = gaussian_kde(np.vstack([r_pts, m_pts]))\n",
    "f = np.reshape(kernel(positions).T, xx.shape)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define levels relative to peak density\n",
    "levels = [0.01 * f_max, 0.1 * f_max, 0.5 * f_max, f_max]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Contours are drawn at specific relative densities (e.g., 1%, 10%, 50% of the peak). Quark models are distinguished using a hatched pattern (`////`) to ensure legibility in black-and-white.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Curve Plotting\n",
    "The function `plot_manifold_curves` plots the raw lines.\n",
    "*   **Panel 1:** Hadronic curves (Green).\n",
    "*   **Panel 2:** Quark curves (Magenta).\n",
    "*   **Panel 3:** Both populations overlaid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transparency (`alpha`) is used to show density: regions where many lines overlap appear darker.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Constraints and Formatting\n",
    "A helper function `_apply_common_formatting` ensures both plot styles share the same physical context.\n",
    "*   **Buchdahl Wedge:** A gray shaded region indicates the zone forbidden by General Relativity.\n",
    "*   **J0740 Limit:** A horizontal line at $2.08 M_{\\odot}$ marks the mass of the massive pulsar PSR J0740+66, serving as a lower bound for the maximum mass capability of valid models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The script saves two files to the `plots/` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `fig_1_manifold_triptych.pdf` (Statistical KDE)\n",
    "*   **Type:** Contour Plot.\n",
    "*   **X-axis:** Radius $R$ [km].\n",
    "*   **Y-axis:** Mass $M$ [$M_{\\odot}$].\n",
    "*   **Features:**\n",
    "    *   **Panel (a):** Shows the Hadronic population is tightly constrained in radius (mostly 11-13 km).\n",
    "    *   **Panel (b):** Shows the Quark population spans a much wider range of radii, extending to large radii at low masses.\n",
    "    *   **Panel (c):** The intersection highlights the \"Confusion Region\" where the probabilities overlap significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `fig_1_manifold_curves.pdf` (Morphological)\n",
    "*   **Type:** Line Plot.\n",
    "*   **Features:**\n",
    "    *   Displays the full topological evolution of the stars.\n",
    "    *   Hadronic curves typically curve backward (dR/dM < 0) as mass increases.\n",
    "    *   Quark curves often slope forward (dR/dM > 0) at low masses before turning back, driven by vacuum pressure stability."
