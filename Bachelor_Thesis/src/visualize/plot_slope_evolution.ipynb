    "# Slope Evolution Diagnostics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is used to generate a diagnostic visualization that tracks the topological evolution of neutron star sequences. It correlates the internal stiffness of the star (represented by the speed of sound) with the geometric slope of the Mass-Radius curve ($dR/dM$) at increasing stellar masses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is critical for distinguishing between Hadronic and Quark stars. While Hadronic stars generally compress under gravity (negative slope), Quark stars stabilized by vacuum pressure can exhibit expanding radii (positive slope). This script visualizes how this distinction persists or fades as the stars become more massive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physics and Math\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topological Slope\n",
    "The slope of the Mass-Radius relation serves as a topological order parameter for the phase of matter:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Slope} = \\frac{dR}{dM} \\approx \\frac{R(M + \\delta M) - R(M)}{\\delta M}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Gravity-Bound (Hadronic):** Typically, $\\frac{dR}{dM} < 0$. As mass is added, the gravitational pull increases, compressing the star to a smaller radius.\n",
    "*   **Self-Bound (Quark):** Often, $\\frac{dR}{dM} > 0$ (especially at lower masses). The vacuum pressure $B$ provides a confining force that dominates over gravity, causing the star to grow in size as mass is added.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Speed of Sound\n",
    "The x-axis uses the speed of sound squared at a canonical mass ($1.4 M_{\\odot}$) as a proxy for the \"stiffness\" of the Equation of State:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c_s^2 = \\frac{dP}{d\\epsilon} \\bigg|_{M=1.4}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the observer to see if high-slope behavior is driven by stiff matter ($c_s^2 \\to 1$) or soft matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Configuration and Data Prep\n",
    "The script defines a list of target mass steps to analyze: 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0 $M_{\\odot}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "targets = [\n",
    "    {'col': 'Slope14', 'mass': '1.4'},\n",
    "    {'col': 'Slope16', 'mass': '1.6'},\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure statistical independence in the plot, duplicates are removed so that only one point per EoS curve is plotted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Plotting Loop\n",
    "A 2x2 grid of subplots is initialized. The script iterates through the four target masses. For each mass step:\n",
    "1.  **Data Filtering:** Rows with `NaN` values for the specific slope column are dropped. This automatically filters out stars that collapse into black holes before reaching the target mass (e.g., a soft EoS might not reach 2.0 $M_{\\odot}$).\n",
    "2.  **Scatter Plotting:**\n",
    "    *   Hadronic stars are plotted in Green (`COLORS['H_main']`).\n",
    "    *   Quark stars are plotted in Magenta (`COLORS['Q_main']`).\n",
    "    *   The points are set with `alpha=0.5` to visualize density clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Axis Locking and formatting\n",
    "To allow for direct comparison between panels, the axes are locked to fixed ranges defined in `CONSTANTS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ax.set_xlim(CONSTANTS['PLOT_CS2_LIM'])\n",
    "ax.set_ylim(CONSTANTS['PLOT_SLOPE_LIM'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A horizontal line at $Slope = 0$ is drawn to visually separate the \"compressing\" regime from the \"expanding\" regime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The script generates a single file: `plots/fig_slope_evolution_paper_style.pdf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Layout:** 2x2 Grid.\n",
    "*   **X-Axis (All Panels):** Speed of Sound squared $c_s^2$ at $1.4 M_{\\odot}$.\n",
    "*   **Y-Axis (Varies):** Slope $dR/dM$ evaluated at 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0 $M_{\\odot}$.\n",
    "*   **Visual Features:**\n",
    "    *   **Hadronic Population (Green):** Predominantly located below the zero line (negative slope), indicating compression.\n",
    "    *   **Quark Population (Magenta):** A significant portion lies above the zero line (positive slope), especially in the 1.4 $M_{\\odot}$ panel.\n",
    "    *   **Evolution:** As the mass increases (moving from the first to the last panel), the Quark population migrates downward, eventually crossing into negative slopes as gravity begins to dominate over the vacuum pressure forces at high masses."
