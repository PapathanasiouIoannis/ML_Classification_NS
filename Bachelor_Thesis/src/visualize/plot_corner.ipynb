    "# Feature Corner Plot Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is used to generate corner plots (also known as scatter plot matrices or pair plots) for the dataset. These visualizations are essential for understanding the multi-dimensional correlations between different physical parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script distinguishes between two domains of features:\n",
    "1.  **Macroscopic Observables:** Quantities measurable by telescopes (Mass, Radius, Tidal Deformability).\n",
    "2.  **Microscopic Physics:** Internal properties of the star (Central Density, Sound Speed, Topological Slope).\n",
    "\n",
    "By plotting these variables against each other, the script reveals how the Hadronic and Quark populations overlap or separate in different subspaces, which is critical for interpreting the performance of the machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physics and Math\n",
    "\n",
    "While this script focuses on visualization, it handles variables representing specific physical concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Macroscopic Variables:**\n",
    "    *   $R$: Stellar Radius [km].\n",
    "    *   $M$: Stellar Mass [$M_{\\odot}$].\n",
    "    *   $\\Lambda$: Dimensionless Tidal Deformability (plotted as $\\log_{10}\\Lambda$).\n",
    "*   **Microscopic Variables:**\n",
    "    *   $\\varepsilon_c$: Central Energy Density [MeV/fm$^3$].\n",
    "    *   $c_s^2$: Speed of Sound squared at the center (dimensionless).\n",
    "    *   Slope ($dR/dM|_{1.4}$): The derivative of the Radius with respect to Mass at $1.4 M_{\\odot}$, serving as a topological indicator of the phase transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability distributions shown on the diagonal and the contours in the lower triangle are estimated using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Shared Helper Function\n",
    "The core logic is encapsulated in the `generate_corner` function to avoid code duplication between the Macro and Micro plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Preparation:**\n",
    "A subset of the data (e.g., 5000 samples) is selected to keep file sizes manageable while maintaining statistical representativeness. Column names are mapped to LaTeX-formatted strings for publication-quality labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PairGrid Setup:**\n",
    "The `seaborn.PairGrid` class is used to create the matrix layout. The script defines three custom plotting functions to achieve a specific \"Cloud and Core\" aesthetic:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`plot_cloud`:** Draws the full dataset as faint scatter points. This visualizes the entire valid parameter space, including outliers.\n",
    "*   **`plot_core`:** Draws KDE contours (50% and 90% levels) on top of the scatter cloud. This highlights where the majority of the population resides.\n",
    "*   **`plot_diag`:** Draws the 1D marginal distributions on the diagonal.\n",
    "    *   **Hadronic (Label 0):** Plotted as solid, filled curves.\n",
    "    *   **Quark (Label 1):** Plotted as dashed lines with a hatched pattern to distinguish them in black-and-white prints.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def plot_diag(x, **kwargs):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    # Quark (1): Hatched (No Fill)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        sns.kdeplot(x=x, color=color, fill=False, linestyle='--', ...)\n",
    "        # Manually add hatch pattern\n",
    "        ax.fill_between(..., hatch='////', alpha=0.5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limits:**\n",
    "Axis limits are applied using the ranges defined in `src.const.CONSTANTS` to ensure these plots match other figures in the thesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Macroscopic Plot (Observables)\n",
    "The first routine generates the plot for Observables.\n",
    "*   **Variables:** Radius, Mass, and $\\log_{10}\\Lambda$.\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** This plot shows the \"observable phase space\" available to astronomers (e.g., LIGO/Virgo and NICER data).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Microscopic Plot (Internal Physics)\n",
    "The second routine generates the plot for Internal Physics.\n",
    "*   **Variables:** Central Density, Sound Speed, and Slope.\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** This plot visualizes the internal engine of the star. It highlights fundamental differences, such as Quark stars generally having higher sound speeds and different M-R slopes compared to Hadronic stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The script produces two PDF files in the `plots/` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`fig_corner_macro.pdf`**:\n",
    "    *   **Matrix:** 3x3 grid.\n",
    "    *   **Variables:** Radius, Mass, Log Tidal.\n",
    "    *   **Features:** Shows the strong correlation between Radius and Tidal Deformability, and the distinct separation of Hadronic (Green) and Quark (Magenta) populations in the Mass-Radius plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`fig_corner_micro.pdf`**:\n",
    "    *   **Matrix:** 3x3 grid.\n",
    "    *   **Variables:** Central Density, Sound Speed, Slope.\n",
    "    *   **Features:** Shows that Quark stars tend to have higher sound speeds ($c_s^2 \\to 1/3$ or higher) and distinct slopes compared to the Hadronic population. The separation is often clearer in this space than in the macroscopic space."
