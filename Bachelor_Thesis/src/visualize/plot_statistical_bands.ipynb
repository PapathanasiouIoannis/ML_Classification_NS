    "# `src/visualize/plot_statistical_bands.py` – Statistical Aggregator\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Algorithmic Challenge: Aligning Heterogeneous Data\n",
    "The raw dataset consists of $\\sim 20,000$ distinct EoS curves. Each curve is sampled at different pressure steps and covers a different mass range.\n",
    "*   **Problem**: We cannot simply average the dataframes column-wise. Row 50 in Curve A might be at $1.2 M_{\\odot}$, while Row 50 in Curve B is at $1.9 M_{\\odot}$.\n",
    "*   **Solution**: **Grid-Based Interpolation**. The script defines common x-axis grids and maps every individual physical curve onto these grids using linear or spline interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The Aggregation Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step A: Grid Definition\n",
    "The script defines universal evaluation vectors based on plotting limits in `const.py`:\n",
    "1.  **Energy Grid**: `eps_common` (Log-spaced, $10^2 \\to 10^4$ MeV/fm³). Used for the EoS panel.\n",
    "2.  **Mass Grid**: `mass_common` (Linearly spaced, $0.1 \\to 3.0 M_{\\odot}$). Used for the Tidal Deformability panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step B: The Interpolation Loop\n",
    "The script iterates through every unique `Curve_ID` in the dataset (using `tqdm` for progress tracking). For each curve:\n",
    "1.  **EoS Interpolation ($P$ vs $\\varepsilon$)**:\n",
    "    *   Since pressure spans orders of magnitude, interpolation is performed in **Log-Log space**.\n",
    "    *   $f_{eos} = \\text{interp1d}(\\log \\varepsilon, \\log P)$.\n",
    "    *   The interpolated pressure vector is stored in a matrix row.\n",
    "2.  **Tidal Interpolation ($\\Lambda$ vs $M$)**:\n",
    "    *   $\\Lambda$ drops exponentially with mass. Interpolation is performed in **Semi-Log space**.\n",
    "    *   $f_{lam} = \\text{interp1d}(M, \\log_{10} \\Lambda)$.\n",
    "    *   The result is stored in the Lambda matrix.\n",
    "3.  **M-R Collection**:\n",
    "    *   Radius is not a single-valued function of Mass (the curve turns back at $M_{max}$). Therefore, interpolation is impossible/ill-defined.\n",
    "    *   Instead, the script simply collects raw $(R, M)$ points into massive arrays for density estimation later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step C: Statistical Reduction\n",
    "Once the matrices are populated (Shape: $[N_{curves}, N_{grid}]$), the script computes column-wise statistics:\n",
    "*   **5th Percentile**: The lower bound of the 90% Confidence Interval (CI).\n",
    "*   **50th Percentile**: The Median behavior.\n",
    "*   **95th Percentile**: The upper bound of the 90% CI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Smoothing**: To prevent the bands from looking jagged due to finite sampling noise, a **Gaussian Filter** (`scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter1d`, $\\sigma=2.0$) is applied to the percentile vectors before plotting.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Panel Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Panel A: Equation of State ($P(\\varepsilon)$)\n",
    "*   **Method**: Plots the smoothed percentiles on Log-Log axes.\n",
    "*   **Visual**:\n",
    "    *   **Hadronic (Green)**: The band is wide at high densities, reflecting the large uncertainty in nuclear physics (Soft vs. Stiff models).\n",
    "    *   **Quark (Magenta)**: The band is narrower and typically follows a slope $\\gamma \\approx 1$ (Conformal limit $P \\propto \\varepsilon/3$), visually distinct from the steeper hadronic rise.\n",
    "*   **Constraint**: A dotted line marks the **Causal Limit** ($P = \\varepsilon$), the absolute physical ceiling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Panel B: Mass-Radius ($M(R)$)\n",
    "*   **Method**: **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**. Since we cannot interpolate $R(M)$, we estimate the probability density of the scatter cloud.\n",
    "    *   Uses `scipy.stats.gaussian_kde` on the accumulated $(R, M)$ points.\n",
    "    *   Draws contours at 10% and 100% density levels.\n",
    "*   **Constraint**: The **Buchdahl Limit** region is shaded gray.\n",
    "    $$ R < \\frac{9}{4} \\frac{GM}{c^2} \\approx 2.25 \\times 1.4766 \\times M $$\n",
    "    This visualizes the General Relativistic prohibition on static fluid spheres existing in this corner of phase space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Panel C: Tidal Deformability ($\\Lambda(M)$)\n",
    "*   **Method**: Plots the smoothed percentiles on Semi-Log axes.\n",
    "*   **Physics Result**: This is the most crucial panel for the thesis argument.\n",
    "    *   At $1.4 M_{\\odot}$, the Green band (Hadronic) sits significantly *higher* than the Magenta band (Quark).\n",
    "    *   This statistically confirms that Hadronic stars are \"fluffier\" (more deformable) than self-bound Quark stars, justifying why Model A (which sees $\\Lambda$) succeeds where Model Geo fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Visual Styling\n",
    "The script enforces the publication standards defined in `style_config.py`:\n",
    "*   **Hatching**: Quark bands use `hatch='////'` to ensure distinguishability in black-and-white prints.\n",
    "*   **Alpha Blending**: Bands use `alpha=0.25` to allow overlapping regions to be seen (the \"Intersection\").\n",
    "*   **Unified Legend**: A custom legend is created using `matplotlib.patches.Patch` to represent the statistical bands, rather than labeling every single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Output Files\n",
    "*   **`plots/fig_statistical_bands.pdf`**: A clean, statistical summary of the physical dataset, free from the visual clutter of plotting 20,000 individual lines."
