    "# Slope vs Radius Diagnostic Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is used to generate a diagnostic visualization that correlates the standard observable radius at $1.4 M_{\\odot}$ with the topological slope of the Mass-Radius curve at various mass steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is performed to investigate whether the geometric compactness of a star (represented by $R_{1.4}$) is predictive of its topological behavior (whether it compresses or expands with added mass). This visualization is arranged as a 2x2 grid, tracking the evolution of this correlation as the stellar mass increases from $1.4 M_{\\odot}$ to $2.0 M_{\\odot}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physics and Math\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topological Slope\n",
    "The slope of the Mass-Radius curve serves as a proxy for the stability mechanism of the star:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Slope} = \\frac{dR}{dM} \\approx \\frac{R(M+\\delta M) - R(M)}{\\delta M}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Negative Slope ($\\frac{dR}{dM} < 0$):** Indicates a star dominated by gravity, where adding mass increases central pressure and compresses the star. This is typical for Hadronic matter.\n",
    "*   **Positive Slope ($\\frac{dR}{dM} > 0$):** Indicates a star stabilized by vacuum pressure (self-bound), where adding mass increases the volume faster than gravity compresses it. This is a signature of Quark matter (Generalized CFL) in certain regimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Radius Proxy\n",
    "The x-axis variable, $R_{1.4}$, acts as a standard reference point for the \"fluffiness\" or compactness of the Equation of State. By fixing the x-axis to $R_{1.4}$ across all panels, the plot reveals how the properties of the star at canonical mass predict its behavior at higher masses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Configuration and Data Filtering\n",
    "The script defines a list of four target diagnostics, representing the slope evaluated at different mass coordinates: $1.4, 1.6, 1.8,$ and $2.0 M_{\\odot}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that each Equation of State (EoS) is represented equally, duplicate entries are removed based on the `Curve_ID`. This prevents the visualization from being biased by EoS models that happen to have more sampled points in the raw dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Filter to unique EoS curves\n",
    "unique_stars = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['Curve_ID'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Plotting Loop\n",
    "A 2x2 grid of subplots is initialized. The script iterates through the four mass targets. For each iteration:\n",
    "1.  **NaN Removal:** Rows where the specific slope is undefined (e.g., if the star collapses before reaching $2.0 M_{\\odot}$) are dropped.\n",
    "2.  **Scatter Plotting:**\n",
    "    *   Hadronic models are plotted in Green.\n",
    "    *   Quark models are plotted in Magenta.\n",
    "    *   Rasterization is enabled (`rasterized=True`) to keep the file size manageable given the large number of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Formatting and Reference Lines\n",
    "A horizontal line at $\\text{Slope} = 0$ is added to visually separate the \"compressing\" and \"expanding\" regimes. Axis limits are retrieved from `src.const.CONSTANTS` to ensure consistency with other diagnostic plots in the thesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ax.set_xlim(CONSTANTS['PLOT_R_LIM'])\n",
    "ax.set_ylim(CONSTANTS['PLOT_SLOPE_LIM'])\n",
    "ax.axhline(0, color='black', linestyle=':', ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The script saves a single PDF file: `plots/fig_slope_vs_radius_paper_style.pdf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Layout:** 2x2 Grid corresponding to masses $1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0 M_{\\odot}$.\n",
    "*   **X-Axis:** Radius at $1.4 M_{\\odot}$ ($R_{1.4}$) [km].\n",
    "*   **Y-Axis:** Slope $dR/dM$ at the specific panel mass.\n",
    "*   **Visual Features:**\n",
    "    *   **Hadronic Cluster (Green):** Typically located at larger radii ($11-14$ km) with negative slopes.\n",
    "    *   **Quark Cluster (Magenta):** Often found at smaller radii ($< 11$ km) with slopes that can be positive (expanding) or negative (compressing).\n",
    "    *   **Evolution:** As the target mass increases (moving through the panels), the slope of the Quark population generally trends downward, indicating that even self-bound stars eventually succumb to gravitational compression at high masses."
