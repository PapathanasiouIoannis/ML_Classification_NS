    "# Micro-Macro Correlation Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is used to generate Figures 16, 17, and 18 for the thesis. These plots visualize the direct correlations between the microscopic properties of the stellar core (internal physics) and the macroscopic observables (external measurements).\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of these visualizations is to bridge the gap between nuclear theory and astrophysics. They demonstrate how internal parameters—such as central density, sound speed, and the topological slope of the mass-radius curve—manifest in observable quantities like Radius, Maximum Mass, and Tidal Deformability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physics and Math\n",
    "\n",
    "The script investigates three key physical relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Core Density vs. Radius\n",
    "The radius of a neutron star is determined by the pressure gradients in the interior.\n",
    "*   **Hadronic Stars:** Typically have lower central densities $\\varepsilon_c$ for a given radius compared to compact Quark stars.\n",
    "*   **Saturation Density:** The density of atomic nuclei, $\\rho_{sat} \\approx 2.8 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ g/cm}^3$ (approx. $150 \\text{ MeV/fm}^3$), is used as a reference point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Stiffness vs. Maximum Mass\n",
    "The maximum mass $M_{max}$ a star can support against collapse is dictated by the stiffness of the Equation of State (EoS). The speed of sound squared, $c_s^2$, is a proxy for stiffness:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c_s^2 = \\frac{dP}{d\\epsilon}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Causal Limit:** $c_s^2 \\le 1$ (speed of light).\n",
    "*   **Conformal Limit:** In high-density QCD, $c_s^2$ is expected to approach $1/3$.\n",
    "*   **Stability:** Stiffer matter (higher $c_s^2$) can generally support massive stars (like PSR J0740+66).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Topological Slope vs. Deformability\n",
    "The slope of the Mass-Radius curve ($dR/dM$) acts as a topological order parameter distinguishing the two populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Slope} = \\frac{dR}{dM} \\bigg|_{1.4 M_{\\odot}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Hadronic Branch:** Typically compressed by gravity, so $dR/dM < 0$.\n",
    "*   **Quark Branch:** Often dominated by vacuum pressure effects, leading to $dR/dM > 0$.\n",
    "*   **Correlation:** This slope is plotted against Tidal Deformability $\\Lambda$, linking the geometric shape of the sequence to the star's \"fluffiness.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Figure 16: Density vs. Radius\n",
    "This function generates a scatter plot linking Central Density to Radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Subsample 10k points for performance\n",
    "df_sample = df.sample(n=min(10000, len(df)), random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.scatterplot(data=df_sample, x='Eps_Central', y='Radius', ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "*   **Subsampling:** Because the dataset contains huge numbers of points, a random sample is taken to keep the vector graphics file size manageable.\n",
    "*   **Reference Line:** A vertical line is drawn at $150 \\text{ MeV/fm}^3$ to mark the nuclear saturation density.\n",
    "*   **Scale:** The x-axis (Density) is plotted on a logarithmic scale to cover the wide range from crust densities to core densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Figure 17: Stiffness vs. Maximum Mass\n",
    "This plot requires identifying the single most massive star for each EoS curve, rather than plotting every star in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Sort by Mass Descending\n",
    "df_sorted = df.sort_values('Mass', ascending=False)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Drop duplicates on Curve_ID, keeping the first (heaviest) one\n",
    "max_mass_stars = df_sorted.drop_duplicates(subset=['Curve_ID'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "*   **Data Filtering:** The code isolates the star with $M_{max}$ for each unique `Curve_ID`.\n",
    "*   **Plotting:** The central speed of sound of this specific star is plotted against its mass.\n",
    "*   **Limits:** Reference lines are added for the J0740 pulsar mass limit ($2.08 M_{\\odot}$), the conformal limit ($c_s^2 = 1/3$), and the causal limit ($c_s^2 = 1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Figure 18: Slope vs. Tidal Deformability\n",
    "This plot focuses on the \"canonical\" mass region.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Focus on the canonical mass region (1.4 M_sun +/- 0.05)\n",
    "df_14 = df[np.abs(df['Mass'] - 1.4) < 0.05].copy()\n",
    "```\n",
    "*   **Filtering:** Only stars close to $1.4 M_{\\odot}$ are selected.\n",
    "*   **Plotting:** The topological slope is plotted against $\\Lambda$.\n",
    "*   **Reference:** A vertical line at `Slope = 0` separates the collapsing (Hadronic-like) branch from the expanding (Quark-like) branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The script saves three PDF files to the `plots/` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`fig_16_density_radius.pdf`**:\n",
    "    *   **X-axis:** Central Energy Density $\\varepsilon_c$ (Log scale).\n",
    "    *   **Y-axis:** Radius $R$.\n",
    "    *   **Insight:** Shows that for a fixed radius, Quark stars typically require higher central densities than Hadronic stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`fig_17_stiffness_maxmass.pdf`**:\n",
    "    *   **X-axis:** Central Speed of Sound $c_s^2$ at $M_{max}$.\n",
    "    *   **Y-axis:** Maximum Mass $M_{max}$.\n",
    "    *   **Insight:** Demonstrates that to support massive stars (like J0740), the EoS must be stiff ($c_s^2$ is high). Many models cluster near or above the conformal limit ($1/3$).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **`fig_18_slope_lambda.pdf`**:\n",
    "    *   **X-axis:** Slope $dR/dM$ at $1.4 M_{\\odot}$.\n",
    "    *   **Y-axis:** Tidal Deformability $\\Lambda_{1.4}$.\n",
    "    *   **Insight:** Reveals a continuous mapping where negative slopes correlate with lower $\\Lambda$ (Hadronic) and positive slopes correlate with higher $\\Lambda$ (Quark), with a crossover region near slope zero."
