    "# Visualization Suite Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This document details the visualization modules used in the thesis project. These scripts transform raw simulation data and machine learning predictions into figures. The visualization suite is divided into three main categories:\n",
    "1.  **Physics Verification:** validating the generated Equations of State (EoS) against theoretical constraints.\n",
    "2.  **Manifold Visualization:** mapping the distributions of stars in macroscopic and microscopic phase spaces.\n",
    "3.  **Machine Learning Diagnostics:** interpreting the performance and decision-making processes of the classifiers.\n",

    "## style_config.py\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role in the Project\n",
    "This script establishes the global graphical standards for the entire project. It ensures that all figures are consistent with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Standards\n",
    "Instead of default settings, specific parameters are enforced to maximize readability and compatibility:\n",
    "*   **Typography:** Computer Modern fonts (Type 1/TrueType) are used for all text and mathematical symbols ($...$) to match standard LaTeX documents.\n",
    "*   **Color Palette:** A custom dictionary defines high-contrast colors for distinguishing populations:\n",
    "    *   **Hadronic (Standard):** Green tones.\n",
    "    *   **Quark (CFL):** Magenta tones.\n",
    "    *   **Constraints:** Black/Gray for observational limits (e.g., causality, unitarity).\n",
    "    *   **Errors:** Gold/Blue for False Negatives/Positives.\n",
    "*   **Geometry:** Figures are sized for standard page widths, with inward-facing ticks.\n",

    "\n",
    "## plot_theoretical_eos.py\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role in the Project\n",
    "This script visualizes the \"Priors\" of the simulation. It generates a spaghetti plot of Pressure versus Energy Density ($P(\\epsilon)$) for a random subset of the generated models. This confirms that the synthetic dataset covers the physically relevant phase space and respects fundamental bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physics and Equations\n",
    "The Equation of State relates pressure $P$ to energy density $\\epsilon$. Two fundamental physical limits are plotted for reference:\n",
    "1.  **Causality Limit:** The stiffest possible matter allowed by special relativity, where the speed of sound equals the speed of light ($c_s = 1$).\n",
    "    $$ P = \\epsilon $$\n",
    "2.  **Conformal Limit:** The theoretical asymptotic limit for non-interacting quarks at infinite density.\n",
    "    $$ P = \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon \\quad \\implies \\quad c_s^2 = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "*   A set of random seeds is selected.\n",
    "*   The `worker_get_plot_curve` module is invoked in parallel to generate high-resolution $P-\\epsilon$ grids for both Hadronic and Quark models.\n",
    "*   The curves are plotted on a log-log scale.\n",
    "*   The theoretical limits are overlaid to verify that no generated model violates causality (crosses the $P=\\epsilon$ line).\n",
    "\n",
    "## plot_stability_window.py\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role in the Project\n",
    "This script verifies that the generated Quark Star models reside within the theoretical \"Stability Window\" of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). It plots the Vacuum Pressure ($B$) against the Pairing Gap ($\\Delta$) and Strange Quark Mass ($m_s$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physics and Equations\n",
    "For Strange Quark Matter to be the true ground state of strong interactions (the Bodmer-Witten hypothesis), it must be:\n",
    "1.  **Stable relative to Iron:** The energy per baryon at zero pressure must be less than $930$ MeV. This sets a **lower bound** on the Bag Constant $B$.\n",
    "2.  **Unstable relative to Neutrons (at low density):** Ordinary nuclei must not spontaneously decay into quark matter. This sets an **upper bound** on $B$, which depends on the gap $\\Delta$:\n",
    "    $$ B_{max}(\\Delta) \\approx \\frac{3}{4\\pi^2}\\mu_n^4 + \\frac{3}{\\pi^2}\\Delta^2 \\mu_n^2 $$\n",
    "    where $\\mu_n$ is the neutron chemical potential.\n",

    "### Role in the Project\n",
    "This script demonstrates the fundamental difference in surface boundary conditions between the two classes of stars. It highlights the \"Forbidden Gap\" in density space that separates gravity-bound stars from self-bound stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physics and Equations\n",
    "*   **Hadronic Stars:** Have a crust made of iron nuclei. The density at the surface drops to zero (or negligible atomic density) as pressure vanishes.\n",
    "    $$ \\epsilon_{surf} \\approx 0 $$\n",
    "*   **Quark Stars:** Are \"self-bound\" by the strong interaction. At the surface ($P=0$), the density remains finite and high, approximately four times the Bag Constant.\n",
    "    $$ \\epsilon_{surf} \\approx 4B $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "*   The surface density ($\\epsilon_{surf}$) is extracted for all stars.\n",
    "*   A Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is plotted for the Quark population, showing a peak around $400-600$ MeV/fm$^3$.\n",
    "*   The Hadronic population is represented as a vertical line at $\\epsilon=0$.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Physics and Equations\n",
    "The plot consists of three panels corresponding to the key equations of stellar structure:\n",
    "1.  **Equation of State:** $P$ vs. $\\epsilon$ (Log-Log). Shows the stiffness of matter.\n",
    "2.  **Mass-Radius Relation:** $M$ vs. $R$. Defined by the TOV equilibrium.\n",
    "    $$ \\frac{dP}{dr} = -\\frac{G\\epsilon m}{r^2} \\dots $$\n",
    "3.  **Tidal Deformability:** $\\Lambda$ vs. $M$. Defined by the Riccati equation for metric perturbation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "*   **Interpolation:** Because every star has a different central pressure, the curves are interpolated onto a common grid of densities and masses.\n",
    "*   **Statistics:** At each grid point, the median, $5^{th}$ percentile, and $95^{th}$ percentile are calculated.\n",
    "*   **Plotting:** These statistics are rendered as shaded confidence bands (solid for Hadronic, hatched for Quark).\n",
    "*   **Constraints:** Observational limits (GW170817, PSR J0740) are overlaid to show consistency with reality.\n",

    "## plot_statistical_bands.py\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role in the Project\n",
    "This script is a variant of the Grand Summary that focuses specifically on producing clean, smoothed statistical bands. It is used to generate the \"Theoretical Prior\" figure, emphasizing the overlap and distinct regions of the two populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "*   Similar to `plot_grand_summary`, it aggregates curves by ID.\n",

    "1.  Hadronic Population Only.\n",
    "2.  Quark Population Only.\n",
    "3.  Intersection/Overlay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "*   **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE):** The density of stars in the Mass-Radius plane is estimated using a Gaussian kernel.\n",
    "*   **Contouring:** Isodensity contours (e.g., enclosing 99%, 50%, and 10% of the population) are drawn.\n",
    "*   **Overlay:** The intersection panel highlights the \"Confusion Region\" where the two populations overlap, indicating where classification is physically difficult or impossible based on Mass and Radius alone.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Role in the Project\n",
    "This script extends the manifold visualization into 3D space, plotting Mass ($M$), Radius ($R$), and Tidal Deformability ($\\Lambda$) simultaneously. It proves that while populations may overlap in 2D projections (e.g., $M-R$), they are often separable in the full 3D higher-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "*   A 3D scatter plot is generated.\n",
    "*   **Marginal Projections:** The 3D cloud is projected onto the \"walls\" of the plot (xy, xz, yz planes) using KDE. This creates \"shadows\" that represent the 2D correlations (e.g., Mass-Radius, Radius-Tidal).\n",

    "*   Similar to the macroscopic 3D plot, stars are scattered in this parameter space.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Physics and Equations\n",
    "*   **Hadronic Branch:** Typically exhibits a negative slope ($dR/dM < 0$). As mass increases, the star compresses and the radius shrinks.\n",
    "*   **Quark Branch:** Often exhibits a positive slope ($dR/dM > 0$) due to the stabilizing effect of the vacuum pressure $B$.\n",
    "*   **Stability Criterion:** A slope of zero ($dR/dM = 0$) marks the transition to instability (maximum mass).\n",

    "### Algorithm\n",
    "*   The dataset is filtered to extract slope and sound speed values at specific canonical masses ($1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0 M_{\\odot}$).\n",
    "*   A scatter plot is generated.\n",
    "*   Vertical lines mark the conformal limit ($c_s^2 = 1/3$) and causal limit ($c_s^2 = 1$).\n",
