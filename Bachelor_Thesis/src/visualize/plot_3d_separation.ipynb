    "# 3D Phase Space Manifold Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is used to visualize the topological separation between Hadronic and Quark stars in the full three-dimensional space of observables: Mass ($M$), Radius ($R$), and Tidal Deformability ($\\Lambda$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualization produces two outputs: a static PDF for the thesis document and an interactive HTML file (using Plotly) for exploration. A key feature of these plots is the inclusion of \"shadow\" projections on the axis walls. These projections show the density of the populations in 2D subspaces (e.g., the standard Mass-Radius plane), linking the 3D manifold structure to familiar 2D physical relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physics and Math\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification of neutron stars relies on the separation of their Equations of State in the observable parameter space $\\mathcal{S}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{S} = \\{ R, \\, M, \\, \\log_{10}(\\Lambda) \\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensionality Reduction (Projections)\n",
    "While the full dataset exists in 3D, physical constraints are often studied in 2D marginal distributions. The script computes these projections using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). For a set of points $(x_i, y_i)$, the probability density function $P(x,y)$ is estimated and projected onto a plane:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_{proj}(x, y) = \\int P(x, y, z) \\, dz\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the viewer to see the \"shadow\" of the 3D data, effectively reproducing the Mass-Radius relation, the Mass-Tidal relation, and the Radius-Tidal relation on the walls of the 3D bounding box.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Preparation\n",
    "The script first checks for the existence of the logarithmic tidal deformability feature. If it is missing, it is calculated from the raw $\\Lambda$:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if 'LogLambda' not in df.columns:\n",
    "    df['LogLambda'] = np.log10(df['Lambda'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "The data is then split into Hadronic (Label 0) and Quark (Label 1) subsets. Limits for the axes are loaded from `src.const.CONSTANTS` to ensure consistency with other figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Density Grid Calculation\n",
    "A helper function, `get_density_grid`, is defined to compute the KDE for the wall projections.\n",
    "*   It accepts x and y data arrays.\n",
    "*   It creates a meshgrid based on the plot limits.\n",
    "*   It computes the Gaussian KDE and normalizes the result for plotting as contours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Static 3D Plotting (Matplotlib)\n",
    "The script uses `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d` to generate the static figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Scatter Plot:** A subset of points (e.g., 3000) is sampled and plotted as semi-transparent markers to visualize the core \"cloud\" of the data.\n",
    "*   **Wall Projections:** The `plot_mpl_wall` function is used to draw the calculated KDE contours on the $xy$, $xz$, and $yz$ planes (offset to the axis limits).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Floor (z=0): Radius vs Mass\n",
    "plot_mpl_wall(ax, h_data['Radius'], h_data['Mass'], ..., 'z', l_lim[0], ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This renders the familiar Mass-Radius relation on the \"floor\" of the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Interactive 3D Plotting (Plotly)\n",
    "If the `plotly` library is available, an interactive HTML file is generated.\n",
    "*   **Scatter3d:** The main data points are added as interactive markers.\n",
    "*   **Surface Traces:** The KDE grids are converted into 3D surfaces and placed on the bounding box walls.\n",
    "*   **Z-Fighting Fix:** Slight offsets are applied to the wall surfaces to ensure that the Hadronic and Quark layers do not flicker when rendered on top of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if wall_type == 'floor':\n",
    "    z_h = np.full_like(XX, l_lim[0])\n",
    "    z_q = np.full_like(XX, l_lim[0] + 0.02) # Small offset\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The script generates `plots/fig_12_3d_manifold.pdf` (and optionally an HTML file).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **X-Axis:** Radius $R$ [km].\n",
    "*   **Y-Axis:** Mass $M$ [$M_{\\odot}$].\n",
    "*   **Z-Axis:** Log Tidal Deformability $\\log_{10}\\Lambda$.\n",
    "*   **Visual Elements:**\n",
    "    *   **Scatter Cloud:** Shows individual star configurations. Hadronic stars (Green) typically form a distinct branch from Quark stars (Magenta), especially at high masses or low radii.\n",
    "    *   **Wall Shadows:**\n",
    "        *   **Floor ($R-M$):** Shows the standard Mass-Radius relation.\n",
    "        *   **Back Wall ($R-\\Lambda$):** Shows the strong correlation between Radius and Tidal Deformability.\n",
    "        *   **Side Wall ($M-\\Lambda$):** Shows how deformability decreases rapidly as mass increases.\n",
    "*   **Colors:** Hadronic stars are Green; Quark stars are Magenta."
