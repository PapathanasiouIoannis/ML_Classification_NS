    "# QCD Stability Window Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is used to generate a diagnostic plot that verifies the physical consistency of the generated Quark Star models. It visualizes the \"Stability Window\" in the microphysical parameter space—specifically the relationship between the Bag Constant ($B$), the Superconducting Gap ($\\Delta$), and the Strange Quark Mass ($m_s$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot serves two purposes:\n",
    "1.  **Verification:** It confirms that the dataset generator (`worker_quark_gen.py`) correctly sampled parameters where strange quark matter is energetically stable relative to neutrons ($E/A < 939$ MeV).\n",
    "2.  **Constraint Visualization:** It illustrates the theoretical \"wedge\" or window defined by the Bodmer-Witten hypothesis, bounded below by the stability of ordinary nuclei (Iron) and above by the stability of neutrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physics and Math\n",
    "\n",
    "The stability of the Generalized Color-Flavor-Locked (CFL) phase is determined by the energy per baryon at zero pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upper Bound (Neutron Stability)\n",
    "For strange quark matter to be the true ground state of hadronic matter, its energy per baryon must be less than that of the neutron ($m_n = 939$ MeV). This imposes a maximum limit on the vacuum pressure $B$. The script calculates this limit as a function of $\\Delta$ and $m_s$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "B_{max}(\\Delta, m_s) \\approx \\frac{1}{(\\hbar c)^3} \\left[ \\frac{3}{4\\pi^2}\\mu_{lim}^4 + \\frac{3}{\\pi^2}\\left(\\Delta^2 - \\frac{m_s^2}{4}\\right)\\mu_{lim}^2 \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu_{lim} = m_n / 3$ is the critical chemical potential per quark.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lower Bound (Iron Stability)\n",
    "Two-flavor quark matter (non-strange) must *not* be stable, otherwise ordinary atomic nuclei (like $^{56}\\text{Fe}$) would spontaneously decay into quark matter. This imposes a minimum limit on $B$, represented in the code by the constant `Q_B_MIN` (typically derived from the condition $E/A > 930$ MeV for 2-flavor matter).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Filtering\n",
    "The script selects only the Quark Star models (`Label == 1`) from the dataframe. Duplicate entries are removed based on `Curve_ID` to ensure that each point on the plot represents a unique Equation of State (EoS) parametrization.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "q_data = df[df['Label'] == 1].drop_duplicates(subset=['Curve_ID'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Scatter Plot\n",
    "The generated models are plotted as a scatter cloud.\n",
    "*   **X-axis:** Gap Energy $\\Delta$.\n",
    "*   **Y-axis:** Bag Constant $B$.\n",
    "*   **Color:** Strange Quark Mass $m_s$ (using a colormap). This reveals how $m_s$ influences the position of the models within the stable region.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Dynamic Stability Boundaries\n",
    "Since the upper stability bound $B_{max}$ depends on $m_s$, there is no single \"line\" of stability. Instead, the script calculates a \"Stability Uncertainty Band.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `b_max_ms_min`: Calculated using the minimum $m_s$ (e.g., 80 MeV).\n",
    "*   `b_max_ms_max`: Calculated using the maximum $m_s$ (e.g., 120 MeV).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Calculate B_max vector for a specific ms\n",
    "term1 = (3.0 / (4.0 * np.pi**2)) * (mu_limit**4)\n",
    "eff_gap_sq = delta_arr**2 - (ms_val**2 / 4.0)\n",
    "term2 = (3.0 / np.pi**2) * eff_gap_sq * (mu_limit**2)\n",
    "return (term1 + term2) / (hc**3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The region between these two curves is filled to represent the parameter space that *might* be stable depending on the specific value of $m_s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Shading Forbidden Regions\n",
    "To clearly mark the physical limits, the script shades the invalid areas:\n",
    "*   **Above the Band:** Unstable to Neutrons (matter would revert to hadronic state).\n",
    "*   **Below the Iron Line:** Unstable to 2-flavor matter (ordinary matter would decay).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The script saves a single PDF file: `plots/fig_stability_triangle.pdf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **X-axis:** Gap Energy $\\Delta$ [MeV].\n",
    "*   **Y-axis:** Vacuum Pressure $B$ [MeV/fm$^3$].\n",
    "*   **Visual Features:**\n",
    "    *   A central \"triangle\" or wedge where the scattered data points reside.\n",
    "    *   **Gray Shading:** Regions physically forbidden by QCD constraints.\n",
    "    *   **Color Gradient:** Shows that for a fixed $B$ and $\\Delta$, varying $m_s$ shifts the stability margin. Lower $m_s$ (darker colors) generally allows for slightly higher $B$."
