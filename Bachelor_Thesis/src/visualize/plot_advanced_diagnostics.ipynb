    "# Advanced Diagnostic Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is used to generate high-level diagnostic figures that validate both the physical consistency of the dataset and the spatial performance of the machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script performs two distinct tasks:\n",
    "1.  **Universal Relations Check:** It verifies whether the generated data adheres to known astrophysical constraints, specifically the relationship between Compactness and Tidal Deformability (related to I-Love-Q relations).\n",
    "2.  **Misclassification Mapping:** It creates a \"Geography of Failure\" visualization. This maps exactly where in the Mass-Radius phase space the machine learning models make errors, and how those errors diminish as more physical features are added to the classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physics and Math\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compactness\n",
    "The compactness parameter $C$ characterizes how dense an object is relative to a black hole. It is a dimensionless quantity defined as the ratio of the gravitational radius to the actual radius:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C = \\frac{G M}{R c^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code, the constant `A_CONV` represents $\\frac{G M_{\\odot}}{c^2}$ (approximately 1.477 km). The compactness is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C = \\text{A\\_CONV} \\times \\frac{M \\, [M_{\\odot}]}{R \\, [\\text{km}]}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physical Limits\n",
    "Two theoretical limits are visualized to frame the data:\n",
    "1.  **Black Hole Limit:** $C = 0.5$ (The Schwarzschild radius is $2M$, so $R=2M \\implies C=0.5$).\n",
    "2.  **Buchdahl Limit:** $C = 4/9 \\approx 0.444$. This is the maximum theoretical compactness for a static sphere of fluid in General Relativity before it must collapse.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Universal Relations Plotting\n",
    "The function `plot_universal_relations` is used to examine the correlation between Compactness and Tidal Deformability.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Calculate Compactness\n",
    "df['Compactness'] = CONSTANTS['A_CONV'] * (df['Mass'] / df['Radius'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is subsampled for performance, and Hadronic vs. Quark stars are plotted on the $C - \\log_{10}(\\Lambda)$ plane. This visualization confirms that as stars become more compact (higher $C$), their tidal deformability decreases (lower $\\Lambda$), following a tight \"universal\" track regardless of the specific EoS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Misclassification Mapping\n",
    "The function `plot_misclassification_map` visualizes how the decision boundaries of the models evolve. It iterates through the model hierarchy (`Geo` $\\rightarrow$ `D`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prediction and Masking:**\n",
    "For each model, predictions are generated on the test set. Boolean masks are created to identify four categories of points:\n",
    "*   **Correct Hadronic:** $y_{true}=0, y_{pred}=0$\n",
    "*   **Correct Quark:** $y_{true}=1, y_{pred}=1$\n",
    "*   **False Positive (FP):** Hadronic stars classified as Quark.\n",
    "*   **False Negative (FN):** Quark stars classified as Hadronic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layered Plotting:**\n",
    "A 2x3 grid of subplots is created. In each panel:\n",
    "1.  **Background:** Correct predictions are plotted as faint, small dots. This shows the general distribution of the test set.\n",
    "2.  **Foreground:** Errors (FP and FN) are plotted as large 'X' markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Plot Errors (Foreground)\n",
    "ax.scatter(X_test_all.loc[mask_fp, 'Radius'], ..., marker='x', c='#004488', label='False Pos')\n",
    "ax.scatter(X_test_all.loc[mask_fn, 'Radius'], ..., marker='x', c='#DDAA33', label='False Neg')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach highlights *where* the models are confused. For simpler models (like 'Geo'), errors are concentrated in the region where Hadronic and Quark Mass-Radius curves overlap. As features like Tidal Deformability (Model A) and Slope (Model D) are added, these error clusters shrink or disappear.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization Output\n",
    "\n",
    "### Figure 1: Universal Relations\n",
    "*   **X-axis:** Compactness $C$.\n",
    "*   **Y-axis:** Log Tidal Deformability $\\log_{10}\\Lambda$.\n",
    "*   **Content:** A scatter plot showing the inverse relationship between compactness and deformability. Vertical lines mark the Buchdahl limit and the Black Hole limit. This serves as a sanity check that the generated EoS curves obey General Relativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Figure 2: Misclassification Map (5-Panel Grid)\n",
    "*   **Grid Layout:** 2 rows, 3 columns (one per model: Geo, A, B, C, D).\n",
    "*   **Axes:** Mass vs. Radius (standard M-R plot).\n",
    "*   **Markers:**\n",
    "    *   **Faint Dots:** Correctly classified stars.\n",
    "    *   **Blue 'X':** False Positives (Hadronic mistaken for Quark).\n",
    "    *   **Yellow 'X':** False Negatives (Quark mistaken for Hadronic).\n",
    "*   **Observation:** This figure demonstrates the \"Geography of Failure.\" It shows visually how adding physics features clears up ambiguity in specific regions of the Mass-Radius plane (e.g., the confusion region around $1.4 M_{\\odot}$ and $11-13$ km)."
