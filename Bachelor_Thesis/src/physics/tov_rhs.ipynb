    "## Detailed Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This script defines the function `tov_rhs`, which computes the derivatives for the system of differential equations describing a static, spherically symmetric neutron star. It serves as the core \"physics engine\" called by the ODE integrator in `solve_sequence.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function couples the macroscopic General Relativistic equations (Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff) with the microscopic properties of matter (Equation of State). Additionally, it includes the Riccati equation required to calculate the tidal deformability of the star.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physics and Math\n",
    "\n",
    "The script solves for the radial evolution of three quantities: mass $m(r)$, pressure $P(r)$, and the tidal variable $y(r)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Structure Equations (TOV)\n",
    "The macroscopic structure is governed by General Relativity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dm}{dr} = 4\\pi r^2 \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dP}{dr} = - \\frac{G (\\epsilon + P) (m + 4\\pi r^3 P)}{r (r - 2Gm)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ is the energy density and $P$ is the pressure. In the code, factors like $G$ and $4\\pi$ are handled via conversion constants (`G_CONV`, `A_CONV`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Tidal Deformability\n",
    "To determine the tidal Love number $k_2$, a perturbation equation (the Riccati equation) is solved alongside the TOV equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dy}{dr} = -\\frac{1}{r} \\left( y^2 + y F(r) + r^2 Q(r) \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $F(r)$ and $Q(r)$ are metric functions that depend on $P$, $\\epsilon$, and the speed of sound $c_s^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Microphysics (Quark Model)\n",
    "For Quark stars, the pressure $P$ and energy density $\\epsilon$ are analytically related via the chemical potential $\\mu$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = \\frac{3}{4\\pi^2}\\mu^4 + \\frac{3}{\\pi^2}\\left(\\Delta^2 - \\frac{m_s^2}{4}\\right)\\mu^2 - B\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The script solves this quadratic equation for $\\mu^2$ given $P$, and then computes $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Thermodynamics and Microphysics\n",
    "The first half of the function determines the energy density $\\epsilon$ and the speed of sound squared $c_s^2$ (or its inverse, `dedp`) for a given pressure `P`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quark Logic (CFL):**\n",
    "If `is_quark` is true, the script unpacks the Bag constant $B$, Gap $\\Delta$, and strange mass $m_s$. It converts pressure to geometric units and solves the algebraic relation derived from the thermodynamic potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Solve Quadratic for mu^2\n",
    "det = coeff_b**2 - 4*coeff_a*coeff_c\n",
    "mu2 = (-coeff_b + np.sqrt(max(0, det))) / (2*coeff_a)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate Epsilon\n",
    "eps_geom = 3.0 * coeff_a * (mu2**2) + coeff_b * mu2 + B_geom\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hadronic Logic:**\n",
    "If `is_quark` is false, the script handles the crust-core transition.\n",
    "*   **Core:** It interpolates between two parent models (`fA`, `fB`) using the mixing weight $w$ and scales the result by $\\alpha$.\n",
    "*   **Crust:** If $P < P_{trans}$, the analytic crust functions (SLy model) are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Physical Clamps\n",
    "To ensure the numerical solution remains stable and causal, limits are applied to the calculated speed of sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Enforce Causality (v <= c)\n",
    "if cs2_local > 1.0: cs2_local = 1.0 \n",
    "# Enforce Stability (v > 0)\n",
    "if cs2_local < 1e-5: cs2_local = 1e-5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Macroscopic Derivatives\n",
    "The second half of the function implements the General Relativistic equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TOV Equations:**\n",
    "The gradients for pressure `dP_dr` and mass `dm_dr` are computed using the standard Schwarzschild metric terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Riccati Equation:**\n",
    "The terms $Q$ and $F$ are computed, which involve the metric component $e^\\lambda$ (`exp_lambda`) and the speed of sound `cs2_local`. These are combined to find `dy_dr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Q = CONSTANTS['A_CONV'] * CONSTANTS['G_CONV'] * (5.0*epsilon + 9.0*P + (epsilon+P)/cs2_local) * (r**2)\n",
    "Q -= 6.0 * exp_lambda\n",

    "dy_dr = -(y_tidal**2 + y_tidal * F + Q) / r\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns the list of derivatives `[dm_dr, dP_dr, dy_dr]` to be used by the RK45 step."
