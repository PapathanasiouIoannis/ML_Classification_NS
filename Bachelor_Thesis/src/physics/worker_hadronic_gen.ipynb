    "# Hadronic EoS Generation Worker\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is responsible for generating synthetic Equation of State (EoS) curves for hadronic neutron stars. It operates as a worker process that creates \"Label 0\" data for the machine learning pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generator uses a \"Inverse Sampling\" technique. Instead of randomly guessing EoS parameters and hoping to find massive stars, it selects target maximum masses first (e.g., between 2.0 and 3.0 $M_{\\odot}$) and mathematically infers the scaling parameters required to generate them. This ensures the dataset is populated with realistic, high-mass neutron stars consistent with modern observations (like PSR J0740+66), minimizing computational waste.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physics and Math\n",
    "\n",
    "The generation process relies on the properties of homologous scaling for the TOV equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homologous Scaling\n",
    "If an EoS $P(\\epsilon)$ yields a maximum mass $M_{ref}$, a scaled EoS $P'(\\epsilon') = \\alpha P(\\epsilon)$ (where energy density is also scaled) will yield a new maximum mass $M_{new}$. The scaling relationship is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{new} = \\frac{M_{ref}}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\alpha = \\left( \\frac{M_{ref}}{M_{new}} \\right)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The script defines the target mass as a perturbation of the reference mass:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{new} = M_{ref} (1 + \\delta)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta$ is the scaling perturbation. The scaling factor $\\alpha$ is then computed to enforce this mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Causality Constraint\n",
    "Physical matter cannot transmit information faster than light. The speed of sound squared is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c_s^2 = \\frac{dP}{d\\epsilon}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The script enforces the causal limit $c_s^2 \\le 1$. If an EoS becomes \"stiff\" enough to violate this limit at low densities (defined by `CAUSALITY_EPS_LIMIT`), it is rejected as unphysical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slope Feature\n",
    "To capture the topology of the Mass-Radius curve, the local slope is approximated numerically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Slope} = \\frac{\\Delta R}{\\Delta M} \\approx \\frac{R(M+\\Delta M) - R(M)}{\\Delta M}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature distinguishes hadronic branches (typically $dR/dM < 0$) from quark branches (often $dR/dM > 0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Smart Parameter Selection\n",
    "The core logic resides in how parameters are chosen to guarantee a valid star.\n",
    "Two parent models (`nA`, `nB`) are selected from the library, and a mixing weight $w$ is chosen. The \"Base Max Mass\" is the weighted average of the parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# What delta do we need to hit the mass floor?\n",
    "req_delta_min = (m_min_target / base_max_m) - 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# What delta do we need to hit the mass ceiling?\n",
    "req_delta_max = (m_max_target / base_max_m) - 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Intersect with our allowed Smoothness Limit [-DELTA_LIMIT, +DELTA_LIMIT]\n",
    "effective_min = max(req_delta_min, -delta_limit)\n",
    "effective_max = min(req_delta_max, delta_limit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This block calculates the exact range of $\\delta$ required to push the star into the target mass window (defined in `CONSTANTS`). If the required $\\delta$ is too large (violating smoothness limits), the combination is skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Physics Setup\n",
    "Once a valid $\\delta$ is sampled, the scaling factor $\\alpha$ is computed. A \"Transition Jitter\" is also applied to the crust-core transition pressure. This adds variability to the low-density region of the EoS, ensuring the ML model does not overfit to specific transition points.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "target_m = base_max_m * (1.0 + delta)\n",
    "alpha = (base_max_m / target_m)**2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Randomize transition pressure by +/- 20%\n",
    "p_jitter = np.random.uniform(0.80, 1.20)\n",
    "p_trans_mix = p_base_mix * p_jitter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. TOV Solution and Filters\n",
    "The `solve_sequence` function is called to generate the M-R curve. Several strict filters are applied immediately after generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Mass Range:** The star must actually fall within the target mass range.\n",
    "2.  **Early Causality:** The EoS is rejected if the speed of sound saturates ($c_s^2 \\approx 1$) at densities too low to be realistic (controlled by `CAUSALITY_EPS_LIMIT`).\n",
    "3.  **Radius Cap:** Stars with radii $> 14$ km at canonical masses are discarded to match astrophysical constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Feature Extraction\n",
    "If the curve is valid, key diagnostic features are extracted via interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f_R = PchipInterpolator(c_arr[:,0], c_arr[:,1])\n",
    "f_CS2 = interp1d(c_arr[:,0], c_arr[:,5], kind='linear', ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "r_14 = float(f_R(1.4))\n",
    "cs2_at_14 = float(f_CS2(1.4))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Slopes are calculated at 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0 $M_{\\odot}$. If a star is not massive enough to reach these points (e.g., collapses at 1.9 $M_{\\odot}$), `NaN` is stored for the missing features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Data serialization\n",
    "The data is flattened into a list format matching `COLUMN_SCHEMA`. Each point on the stable branch is saved as a row in the dataset, labeled with `0` (Hadronic) and a unique `curve_id`."
