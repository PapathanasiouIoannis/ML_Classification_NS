    "# Advanced Model Diagnostics and Interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "## Role in the Project\n",
    "This script is responsible for the \"Deep Dive\" analysis of the trained machine learning models. While standard metrics (like accuracy and ROC curves) measure *how well* the model performs, the routines in this script allow the researcher to understand *why* the model works and *how robust* it is under realistic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It serves three specific analytical functions:\n",
    "1.  **Scalability Analysis:** It determines if the model has converged or if more simulation data is required (Learning Curves).\n",
    "2.  **Robustness Testing:** It simulates observational errors (noise) to check if the model remains reliable when applied to imperfect astrophysical data.\n",
    "3.  **Physical Interpretability:** It correlates the \"black box\" confidence scores of the model with fundamental physical quantities (such as the speed of sound and topological slope) to verify that the model is learning valid physics rather than statistical artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physics and Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Robustness to Observational Noise\n",
    "In real astrophysics, measurements of Mass and Radius are never exact; they carry statistical uncertainty. To quantify the model's resilience, the test data $\\mathbf{x}$ is perturbed by Gaussian noise $\\eta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{x}_{noisy} = \\mathbf{x}_{true} + \\eta, \\quad \\eta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The degradation of the model's accuracy $A$ is mapped as a function of the noise amplitude $\\sigma$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A(\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbb{I}\\left( \\hat{y}(\\mathbf{x}_i + \\eta_i) = y_i \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\mathbb{I}$ is the indicator function (1 if correct, 0 if wrong). This test determines the maximum observational error $\\sigma_{max}$ under which the classifier remains reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Feature Contribution (SHAP Values)\n",
    "To open the \"black box\" of the Random Forest, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) are computed. Based on cooperative game theory, the prediction $f(x)$ for a specific star is decomposed into the sum of contributions $\\phi_i$ from each feature $i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\phi_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\phi_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\phi_i$ represents the marginal contribution of feature $i$ (e.g., Radius) to the log-odds of the star being classified as a Quark star. A positive $\\phi_i$ indicates the feature pushes the prediction toward \"Quark,\" while a negative value pushes it toward \"Hadronic.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Probability-Physics Correlations (KDE)\n",
    "A key validation step is to check if the model's predicted probability $P(\\text{Quark})$ correlates with the underlying microphysics, even if the model was not trained on those microphysical parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The joint probability density function (PDF) between a physical quantity $Q$ (e.g., central sound speed $c_s^2$) and the model confidence $P$ is estimated using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{f}(Q, P) = \\frac{1}{n h} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} K\\left( \\frac{Q - Q_i}{h} \\right) K\\left( \\frac{P - P_i}{h} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization reveals whether high-confidence Quark predictions ($P \\approx 1$) consistently map to physically distinct regions (e.g., $c_s^2 > 1/3$).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm and Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Learning Curve Generation:**\n",
    "    *   The training dataset is split into increasingly larger subsets (e.g., 10%, 30%, ..., 100%).\n",
    "    *   For each subset size, the model is retrained and evaluated using Cross-Validation.\n",
    "    *   The Training Score and Validation Score are plotted. Convergence (where the two curves meet) indicates that sufficient data has been generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Noise Stress Testing:**\n",
    "    *   The test set features (specifically Radius) are perturbed by injecting random Gaussian noise.\n",
    "    *   The noise level $\\sigma$ is swept from $0$ km to $2.0$ km.\n",
    "    *   The classification accuracy is re-evaluated at each step to define a \"breakdown point\" for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Physics Correlation Mapping:**\n",
    "    *   The model predicts the probability $P(\\text{Quark})$ for every star in the test set.\n",
    "    *   These probabilities are paired with \"hidden\" physical variables that were not used during training, such as:\n",
    "        *   **Central Energy Density ($\\epsilon_c$):** To check if high-density objects are classified as Quark stars.\n",
    "        *   **Speed of Sound ($c_s^2$):** To check if the model respects the conformal limit ($c_s^2 = 1/3$) separation.\n",
    "        *   **Topological Slope ($dR/dM$):** To check if the model implicitly recognizes the stable branch.\n",
    "    *   KDE contours are generated to visualize these correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **SHAP Analysis:**\n",
    "    *   A `TreeExplainer` is applied to the calibrated classifier.\n",
    "    *   Shapley values are computed for the test set.\n",
    "    *   A beeswarm plot is generated to show the global importance and directionality of each feature (e.g., \"Does low Radius always imply Quark matter?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs and Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "*   **Trained Models:** Specifically the observational models (`Geo` and `A`) which are the most relevant for real data.\n",
    "*   **Full Dataset:** Containing both the features used for training ($M, R, \\Lambda$) and the hidden physics columns ($c_s^2, \\epsilon_c$, Slope).\n",
    "*   **Test Set:** The held-out data for unbiased evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "*   **Learning Curve Plot:** A visual check for overfitting or data starvation.\n",
    "*   **Noise Robustness Plot:** A curve showing accuracy vs. injected radial error.\n",
    "*   **Correlation Contour Plots:** Figures linking ML confidence to physical quantities, overlaid with theoretical limits (e.g., $c_s^2 = 1/3$).\n",
    "*   **SHAP Beeswarm Plot:** A summary of feature importance and impact direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connection to the Overall Workflow\n",
    "This analysis is performed **after** model training and **before** the final inference on real candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides the necessary rigorous justification for using the machine learning model. By demonstrating that the model is robust to noise and that its decisions correlate strongly with known QCD physics (sound speed limits, stability windows), this step validates the model as a tool for physical discovery rather than just a statistical black box."
