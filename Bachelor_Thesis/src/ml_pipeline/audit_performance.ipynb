    "# Model Performance Audit and Stress Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Role in the Project\n",
    "This script executes a rigorous \"stress test\" on the trained machine learning models. While global metrics like overall accuracy provide a general summary of performance, they often mask localized failures in specific regions of the parameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary role of this module is to dissect the model's behavior as a function of stellar mass and to evaluate the \"honesty\" of its uncertainty estimates. It answers three critical questions:\n",
    "1.  Does the model's reliability degrade for very massive or very light stars?\n",
    "2.  When the model makes a mistake, is it \"confidently wrong\" or appropriately uncertain?\n",
    "3.  How robust is the classification in the extreme high-mass regime ($M > 2.0 M_{\\odot}$), which is critical for current astrophysical constraints?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physics and Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Mass-Dependent Accuracy\n",
    "Neutron star properties change drastically with mass. Low-mass stars are dominated by the known nuclear crust, while high-mass stars are dominated by the unknown core Equation of State (EoS). To quantify performance across this range, the test set is divided into mass bins $B_i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "B_i = \\{ \\mathbf{x} \\in X_{test} \\mid M_{low, i} \\le M < M_{high, i} \\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For each bin, the local classification accuracy is computed:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Accuracy}(M) = \\frac{1}{|B_i|} \\sum_{\\mathbf{x} \\in B_i} \\mathbb{I}(\\hat{y}(\\mathbf{x}) = y_{true})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbb{I}$ is the indicator function (1 if correct, 0 if incorrect). This reveals the \"Zone of Confidence\"—the mass range where the model is most reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Confidence of Errors (Calibration Check)\n",
    "A well-calibrated model should output probabilities near $0.5$ (uncertainty) when it is likely to be incorrect. If a model outputs a probability $P \\approx 1.0$ (certainty) but the prediction is wrong, it is \"hallucinating.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The confidence level $C$ is defined as the distance of the predicted probability $P$ from the decision boundary ($0.5$), normalized to $[0, 1]$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C = 2 \\times | P(\\text{Quark}) - 0.5 |\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of $C$ is analyzed specifically for the subset of misclassified stars. A distribution skewed toward $0$ indicates a healthy, honest model; a distribution skewed toward $1$ indicates dangerous overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The High-Mass Limit\n",
    "The behavior of the EoS at high densities is of particular interest to nuclear physics. Massive stars ($M > 2.0 M_{\\odot}$) probe the deepest central densities. A specific accuracy metric is computed for this subset:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Accuracy}_{high} = \\text{Accuracy} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad \\{ \\mathbf{x} \\mid M > 2.0 M_{\\odot} \\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that the model does not achieve high global accuracy simply by correctly classifying the abundant low-mass stars while failing on the rare, scientifically valuable high-mass cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm and Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Mass Binning Analysis:**\n",
    "    *   The mass spectrum (e.g., $0.1$ to $3.0 M_{\\odot}$) is segmented into discrete intervals.\n",
    "    *   The test dataset is filtered to isolate stars falling within each interval.\n",
    "    *   For each model (Geometric, Observational, Microphysical), predictions are generated for the stars in the current bin.\n",
    "    *   The accuracy is calculated and plotted against the bin center.\n",
    "    *   A sample count histogram is generated in parallel to ensure that bins with low accuracy are statistically significant and not just artifacts of small sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Error Confidence Analysis:**\n",
    "    *   The Observational Model (Model A) is selected for detailed scrutiny.\n",
    "    *   Predictions are compared against true labels to create a mask of **Misclassified Samples**.\n",
    "    *   The predicted probabilities associated with these errors are extracted.\n",
    "    *   A histogram of these probabilities is plotted. Ideally, the histogram peaks around $0.5$, indicating that the model was \"unsure\" about the cases it got wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **High-Mass Critical Check:**\n",
    "    *   A subset of the test data is created containing only stars with masses greater than $2.0 M_{\\odot}$.\n",
    "    *   Each model is scored against this subset.\n",
    "    *   A status flag is assigned based on the score (e.g., \"Critical Failure\" if accuracy drops below 60%, \"Robust\" if above 90%).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs and Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "*   **Models Dictionary:** The collection of trained classifiers (Geo, A, D).\n",
    "*   **Test Data ($X_{test}, y_{test}$):** The held-out dataset used for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "*   **Accuracy vs. Mass Plot:** A dual-axis figure showing how accuracy evolves with stellar mass, overlaid with the distribution of data points.\n",
    "*   **Error Confidence Histogram:** A visualization of the model's internal probability estimates for incorrect predictions.\n",
    "*   **Audit Report:** A console summary detailing the robustness of the models in the high-mass regime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connection to the Overall Workflow\n",
    "This script serves as the **Quality Assurance** phase of the pipeline. It is executed immediately after `train_model.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from this audit determine whether the models are trustworthy enough to be applied to real observational data in `analyze_candidates.py`. If a model fails the High-Mass check here, its predictions on objects like PSR J0740+66 would be considered unreliable."
